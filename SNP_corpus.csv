Terrorism is wrong no matter where it occurs or who it is against.

Week In Westminster: Your update on a small selection of the many activities being carried out by your SNP MPs.
The debate on the UK s position in Europe is about to become an all-consuming issue. Writing in The World in 2016 special edition for The Economist  Nicola Sturgeon says demand for another independence referendum could be unstoppable.
Brendan O Hara writes about Trident and Labour s moral bankruptcy on the issue:   There is no moral  economic or military case for Trident  however today saw moral bankruptcy from Labour. The vast majority of their MPs abstained  including their own Scottish MP Ian Murray. This is in direct contradiction to Scottish Labour party policy. Only 6 voted with the SNP with 14 voting with the Tories to support Trident. 
Will George Osborne do right today and reverse his decision to cut tax credits? #SpendingReview
Watch John Swinney describe how we will see real term reductions of almost 6 per cent in the funding for public services over the next four years.  Speaking after the Comprehensive Spending Review was announced by the Chancellor  the Deputy First Minister condemned the continued “austerity of choice” but welcomed the U-turn on tax credits as a victory for the 250 000 families in Scotland who would have been painfully impacted by the cuts.
Tory austerity measures are of choice  not necessity.
John Swinney welcomes the Tories dramatic u-turn on tax credits and makes it clear that the Scottish Government will continue to do everything within its power to protect the most vulnerable from the UK Government s austerity measures:  “We know that the Chancellor remains committed to £12bn of welfare cuts  and we will be looking closely at the cuts to other parts of welfare announced in the Spending Review.   We want to use our powers and resources to lift people out of poverty  not just continually mitigate as best we can.   That will be our focus as we draw up spending plans ahead of the Scottish Budget next month. We will set out a progressive and inclusive budget  with tackling inequality at its heart.”
Angus Robertson makes clear today that while the Scottish National Party supports the international initiative on Syria agreed in Vienna to secure a ceasefire in Syria  transition to stable representative government and countering terrorist groups including Daesh.   Unless the Prime Minister answers key questions posed by the Foreign Affairs select committee satisfactorily  the Scottish National Party will not vote for air strikes in Syria.

Angus Robertson MP makes it clear that the case for air strikes on Syria has not been made:   We must not repeat the mistakes of the past  and engage in military action without a comprehensive and credible plan to win the peace. Instead of the Prime Minister’s foolhardy motion  the UK must step up its support for the International Syria Support Initiative and other diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire in Syria and a political transition to stable representative government.

Today is the International Day of Disabled People:   To mark the occasion Communities Minister Marco Biagi represented the SNP Scottish Government at the first Disabled People’s Summit in Edinburgh.  The SNP are committed to promoting and protecting equality and human rights for disabled people. We want to make sure that disabled people can take part fully in all areas of daily and public life  and we are working to break down the barriers to independent living that people may face.  The SNP Government are taking practical steps  such as supporting disabled and young people and their families from birth  through school and into the world of work. We are also investing £5.4 million over 2 years to improve learning disability services in Scotland.  However the UK Government’s harsh welfare reforms are having a disproportionately negative impact on disabled people here in Scotland. We have seen the criteria for disability benefits toughened  services cut and reforms which unfairly target disabled people. 
Scotland is playing its part in the international mitigation of climate change.

Nicola Sturgeon outlining that a political solution in Syria must still be our aim:    You cannot negotiate with Daesh – that much is clear. But what surely must be possible  in the medium to longer term  is a political settlement that ends the fighting in Syria between the other non-Daesh factions  thus depriving the extremists of the chaos and catastrophe in which they have been allowed to thrive. 
Jim Eadie explains why progressive policies in Scotland are putting the Scottish and UK governments streets apart on social housing:   Over the last five years 20 400 new housing association or council homes have been built in Scotland – that’s 400 more than the SNP target for the social rented sector. In turn this has contributed to the Scottish Government not only meeting its target of 30 000 new affordable homes but doing so ahead of schedule. Compare that record of delivery with what is happening in England where latest figures show that the number of new social sector homes has slumped to a record low.  But we know that there is much more still to do. That’s why if re-elected  the SNP will build on this success and invest at least £3 billion to deliver a further 50 000 affordable homes over the next five years.  The Scottish Government is not just investing in new social housing but is also protecting existing stock by abolishing Thatcher’s right to buy policy.  Meanwhile in England  the Tory government has accelerated the sale of council homes and is extending the scheme to housing association homes. The UK Government has also committed to building proportionately fewer new affordable homes than pledged by the SNP and has made no commitment to social housing. 
Ministers have thanked the public for their patience and co-operation after the travel plan which came into force following the closure of the Forth Road Bridge kicked into gear.  The comprehensive plan includes extra bus services and train journeys. Following the first morning rush since the travel plan came into action  it has emerged that buses using the priority routes have much better journey times proving to be half an hour faster than predicted  demonstrating the effectiveness of the bus prioritisation. There is also capacity for additional bus passengers with access to buses much easier from Ferrytoll park and ride.  Further information can be found at the link below.

John Swinney indicates that there are tough choices ahead for Scotland in the wake of Tory Chancellor cuts:    On Wednesday I will set out the Scottish Government’s budget.  I will be doing so against the backdrop of yet more cuts to Scotland s budget by the Tory government. George Osborne is making these cuts out of choice  not necessity. And taken together with the cuts imposed since 2010  he plans to remove one in every eight pounds Scotland has to spend.  What s more  it s not just for one year. The Chancellor will impose real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020.  The SNP Government has consistently shown how a different approach could be taken. We’ve sent detailed recommendations to the UK Government which demonstrate that the deficit could have been reduced while still investing in public services. All done without the scale of cuts chosen by the Chancellor.  But that advice has not been taken and now Scotland is dealing with the reality of the Chancellor’s decision  and the tough choices it brings.  Be assured that your SNP Government will defend and protect the vital public services that the people of Scotland depend on: our schools  hospitals and police. We will not sacrifice them to the Chancellor’s austerity obsession.

The SNP is starting the New Year with a campaign push. Setting out the aims of the Party over the next four months to win the right to an unprecedented third term in government - something not yet achieved by any party or parties since devolution - Nicola Sturgeon makes clear that we will be unveiling a raft of new policies  including on health  education  social security and the economy  in the run-up to polling day:   As we enter 2016  I am looking forward to – and excited about – the election campaign that lies ahead.  I hope all parties and each of the leaders will rise to the challenge of making it a campaign that Scotland can be proud of.  I hope that my party will emerge from it as Scotland s re-elected government and that on May 6  I will be our country s re-elected First Minister. But  no matter what the polls say  we will not take that success for granted.  My pledge is to work every day  between now and then  to prove beyond any doubt that I am the best person  and that the SNP is the best party  to lead Scotland into the next decade.

As Parliament meets for the first time in 2016  Nicola Sturgeon has led a debate reviewing the progress made by the SNP in Government since 2007  and looking ahead to the future.  In the debate  Nicola outlined the SNP Government’s strong record and the firm foundations we have to build on. Scotland’s NHS has a record budget  and our universities are world class and are accessible to more students from deprived backgrounds than in 2007. We have built new colleges  schools  hospitals and health centres in every part of our country  and exceeded our five year target to deliver 30 000 affordable homes.
Nicola Sturgeon today launched Scotland’s new National Improvement Framework alongside her aspiration for Scotland’s education system to be world leading.

This Week at Holyrood: This week the First Minister launched our 2016 election campaign and the National Improvement Framework  MSPs saw the impact of flooding across Scotland and Parliament marked one year since the Charlie Hebdo attack.
One year ago this week the SNP introduced free school meals for all pupils in Primary 1 to 3.  This has been a huge relief for many at a time of tight household budgets – saving families £380 a year for each child. But the benefits of providing free school meals are not just financial. Free school meals make sure that young children get a healthy and nutritious meal every day  improving their concentration in the classroom and helping them to achieve better results.
The Scottish Government is encouraging people to continue checking local weather forecasts and travel information as parts of the country continue to be badly affected by recent flooding and bad weather. The following update contains useful information.

Humza Yousaf highlights the importance of a positive case for remaining in the EU:   I only have an interest in making the positive case for continued membership in a reformed EU.

The Scottish Government is determined to do all we can to secure a vote which keeps the UK in the EU  and protect the benefits we all derive from our place in Europe and do so in a positive manner.

Today I led a debate in the Scottish Parliament on delivering a world class education system.     The SNP has made improving our education system a key priority in government. Our approach so far has seen record Higher and Advanced Higher pass rates  with more of our young people going from school into work  training or additional education than at any time on record.     Every child deserves the chance to reach their potential. To achieve this  we know we need to start getting things right at an early age.
We are asking people for views on different ways to increase fan involvement  which could be included in future legislation.  These include a right to influence the way the club is run  to govern the club or to bid for ownership when it comes up for sale.  The final option is to introduce a right for fans to buy their football club.  Getting this right requires allowing all voices to be heard and that’s why we are consulting.

Today I’m pleased to have announced that the Scottish Government is taking a major step forward in improving transparency of land ownership in Scotland.    It is right that there is a great deal of interest in who owns Scotland. The vibrant debate that the Land Reform Bill has generated is a reflection of its purpose – to encourage greater public interest and participation in our land. Our party had an excellent debate on land ownership at our National Conference last year. As Land Reform Minister I am proud of the measures already included in the Bill  but I also share the view of many members that we should do all that we can to increase transparency of land ownership.
