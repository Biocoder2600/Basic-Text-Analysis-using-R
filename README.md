# Basic Text Analysis using R

This workshop will introduce participants to the R programming language, and show how it can be used by social scientists and humanities researchers for basic text analysis (sometimes also called quantitative text analysis, automated content analysis, or text mining). It will cover the basic assumptions behind quantitative text analysis, the pre-processing steps needed prior to the analysis, and various analytical techniques. If time allows, it will also cover the concept of ‘keyness’.

## R Version

Tt seems the R 3.5 (released just two days ago) is incompatible with the packages. Please try and install R 3.4.4 instead. 

Here's some links for windows and Mac OS X:
